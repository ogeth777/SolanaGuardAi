## ❓ Why Solana Guard AI?

The Solana ecosystem is fast-moving, but this speed comes with risks. Scammers often exploit:
- **Mint Authority**: Printing infinite tokens to dump on buyers.
- **Freeze Authority**: Locking users' funds so they can't sell.
- **Fake Volume**: Creating artificial activity to lure investors.

**Solana Guard AI** automates the due diligence process, checking these invisible risks in seconds so you can trade with confidence.

## 🛡️ Mission
