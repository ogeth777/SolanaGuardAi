## ⚡ What is Solana Guard AI?

**Solana Guard AI** is a dual-core security protocol designed to protect users on high-speed blockchains (**Solana** & **Base**). It combines a real-time technical scanner with an autonomous social agent that actively monitors network sentiment.

In an era of high-speed rug pulls and AI-generated scams, you need a defense system that moves faster than the attackers.

### 🧠 The Dual-Core Architecture

| **1. The Scanner (Technical)** 🛠️ | **2. The Agent (Social)** 🗣️ |
|:---:|:---:|
| **Instant Audit**: Checks Mint Authority, Freeze, and LP locks in <200ms. | **Genius Mode**: Autonomous AI analyzing narratives and social engineering on Moltbook. |
| **Whale Watch**: Detects supply concentration and manipulation risks. | **Active Defense**: Debunks hype, challenges "shills", and educates users 24/7. |
| **Cross-Chain**: Native support for **Solana** and **Base (L2)**. | **Philosopher AI**: Discusses market efficiency, MEV, and the future of on-chain truth. |
